But other than the fact that besuboru is played *-1 with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted *-2 -- even welcomed *-2 -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , for example , must always wear ties when on the road .

Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie and bar graphs , for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum , Mr. Kaminski says 0 *T*-1 , the preparation kits would n't replicate too many , if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures .

According to Dr. Wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created * by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level .

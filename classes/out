For
example
,
if
you
have
a
BST
of
English
words
used
in
a
spell
checker
,
you
might
balance
the
tree
based
on
word
frequency
in
text
corpora
,
placing
words
like
the
near
the
root
and
words
like
agerasia
near
the
leaves
.

Such
a
tree
might
be
compared
with
Huffman
trees
,
which
similarly
seek
to
place
frequently
-
used
items
near
the
root
in
order
to
produce
a
dense
information
encoding
;
however
,
Huffman
trees
only
store
data
elements
in
leaves
and
these
elements
need
not
be
ordered.If
we
do
not
know
the
sequence
in
which
the
elements
in
the
tree
will
be
accessed
in
advance
,
we
can
use
splay
trees
which
are
asymptotically
as
good
as
any
static
search
tree
we
can
construct
for
any
particular
sequence
of
lookup
operations.Alphabetic
trees
are
Huffman
trees
with
the
additional
constraint
on
order
,
or
,
equivalently
,
search
trees
with
the
modification
that
all
elements
are
stored
in
the
leaves
.

from

Most
Buddhists
agree
that
,
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
,
words
are
inadequate
to
describe
the
goal
of
the
Buddhist
path
,
but
concerning
the
usefulness
of
words
in
the
path
itself
,
schools
differ
radically

Three
central
elements
of
Bernard
's
Mariology
are
how
he
explained
the
virginity
of
Mary
,
the
"
Star
of
the
Sea
"
,
how
the
faithful
should
pray
on
the
Virgin
Mary
,
and
how
he
relied
on
the
Virgin
Mary
as
Mediatrix.Bernard
also
held
some
doctrines
which
the
Reformers
would
later
rekindle
at
the
beginnings
of
the
Protestant
movement
.

In

,
two

It
is
uncertain
where
it
was
first
discovered
that
a
combination
of
hydrated
non-hydraulic
lime
and
a
pozzolan
produces
a
hydraulic
mixture
(
see
also
:
Pozzolanic
reaction
)
,
but
concrete
made
from
such
mixtures
was
first
used
by
the
Ancient
Macedonians
Although
any
preservation
of
this
knowledge
in
literary
sources
from
the
Middle
Ages
is
unknown
,
medieval
masons
and
some
military
engineers
maintained
an
active
tradition
of
using
hydraulic
cement
in
structures
such
as
canals
,
fortresses
,
harbors
,
and
shipbuilding
facilities
.
